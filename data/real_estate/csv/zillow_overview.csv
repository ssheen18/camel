29333056,"Built from cream and gray Texas Hill Country limestone in the style of a European mansion house and set in the sunny hills of Barton Creek with views over the OMNI hotel and country club at the rear, while the front garden offers privacy from the road and features many trees, a stocked carp pond and fountain and a small boules or pétanque piste that leads down to the third hole of Fazio Hills golf course.
                
                Floors are 3/4"" solid mahogany throughout except the second kitchen, bathrooms and laundry. Windows and doors all from Andersen except the purpose-built, castle-style wrought front doors.
                
                At the rear, the pool deck and entertainment area is built from Mexican marble and limestone, with the well-fed pool 9' at the deepest with a waterspout feature and a separate large spa. The deck is sealed by gates and is finished off with a shaded lounging area above it and a full sized sunken boules piste with a music system and small bar & grill.
                
                The outdoor space continues below the pool deck to a relatively flat area that opens out to the third hole of the Fazio Hills golf course, so close, a quick hole or two in the morning or evening is not out of the question. 
                
                The land is large enough for a tennis court to be built, or sports hall, bunkhouse, etc due to the lifting of a building-line restriction a few years ago. 
                
                It then flows down fairly steeply to a small dry creek that is the property boundary. Lots of wildlife and lost golf balls.
                
                The first floors of the house are covered with oriental rugs and traditional-to-modern furniture, mostly sourced from eg Louis Shanks.
                
                The main kitchen is a recent addition fitted with an oversize sink, two dishwashers, a hidden sink, and appliances from Miele and Thermador. It moves through to a mirrored dining area that itself gives way to a full wet bar, True ice-maker, wine fridges, beer fridges, and seating for 18 or so.
