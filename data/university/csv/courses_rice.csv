ENGI 304,GOOD VIBRATIONS: AN INTERDIS- CIPLINARY,3.00,"* DISTRIBUTION COURSE: GROUP III
Introduction to physical acoustics and to physiology and psychology of
hearing. Musical, architectural and medical acoustics and
environmental noise control.
Acoustics is the most accessible physical science and many observed
phenomena can be understood without recourse to advanced mathematics.
It provides an excellent example of the formulation of a physical
theory,
the derivation of the field equations, the solution of problems,
experiment and measurement, and applications in the real world.
Acoustics has the additional advantage that the distances and times
involved are easily comprenended (inches and seconds, not nanometers or
picoseconds) and that, in many instances we, ourselves, are the
measuring instruments. The subjective, sometimes ambiguous, realm of
psychoacoustics contrasts with the objective, unambiguous realm of
physical acoustics. This, and the fact that acoustics is inherently an
interdisciplinary subject with musical, architectural, biomedical and
environmental aspects, make this course a good meeting place for majors
and nonmajors.",,,,,,,

literature for ""high brow"" and ""low brow"" reader/writers alike. More
particularly, we will consider how U.S. writers use these gothic devices
to script the diverse racial identities of the populace into a U.S.
narrative and how the gothic represents the writers' fears that such
racial identities will disrupt the cohesiveness of a distinct national
literature. We will read work by Charles Brocken Brown, Edgar Allen Poe,
Stephen King, John Winthrop, Henry James, Edith Wharton, Harriet Jacobs,
