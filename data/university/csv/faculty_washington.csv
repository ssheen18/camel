semantically well founded systems for representing both specific facts about the
world and general rules of inference.  Thus KR encompasses databases, frame
systems, propositional and first order symbolic logic, probabilistic models, mixed
integer programming, and constraint systems.  By ""efficient"" I mean practical
efficiency:  many of the kinds of problems I work on are provably worst case
intractable, but none the less can be solved in practice for surprisingly large
instances.  An example of this is my work on solving logical representations of
planning problems using new randomized algorithms (see the Blackbox project
home page).  Work on knowledge compilation looks at ways to reformulate problem
instances so that they are easier to solve.  A complimentary approach is develop
new search and reasoning algorithms, such as Walksat or the Randomized Rapid
Restart policy.  My ultimate goal is to develop general problem solving systems that
automatically adapt to the structural characteristics of different problem domains. 
In terms of the artificial intelligence ""big picture"", I view KR as being concerned
with a knowledge level model of what goes on in the mind after low-level
perception and before physical action - where the ""mind"" may or may not be
instantiated by a human brain.. Other problem domains I have worked on or am in interested in exploring include
mathematical reasoning, verification, multi-agent and information agent systems,
combinatorial auctions, and biomedical applications.  I particularly welcome
conversations with graduate students who would like to talk about connections
